          "text": "Siegel’s insistence on Hill detailing the physical evidence of her abduction reveals a collective impulse to legitimize the spectacular narrative of alien abduction, the telling of which immediately delegitimizes the storyteller. Bridget Brown notes that most scholarship on alien abduction attempts to situate it “at the intersection of psychology and religion, or myth,” suggesting either an explanation of disorder or simply belief (7). Brown argues that these intersections foreclose study of the material reality of the abductee’s life by pathologizing and delegitimizing them. Siegel unwillingly participates in this practice by constantly prompting Hill to recount the supposed proof. However, “nonmaterial ideas, beliefs, and presences may illicit in us very real reactions, emotions, and behaviors,” suggesting that “the pain of alien abduction is indeed real because it has real effects” (Brown 9). What else would we hear if we listened to alien abductees with an attunement to their reality, without the goal of legitimizing them? What are they trying to tell us about themselves outside the boundaries of their imposed categorization?"
