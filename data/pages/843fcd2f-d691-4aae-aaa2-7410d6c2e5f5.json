          "text": "While Siegel and Hill’s conversation reifies the typical narrative of abduction with a focus on legitimization and victimization, Hill also expresses how “participating in the cultural practice of being an alien abductee” allows her to become an agent “in the social drama of alien abduction” (Brown 18). To observe this, I listen for her sense of humor, which becomes another component of her rehearsed storytelling practice. One of the most salient examples happens when Hill is discussing the U.S. military’s involvement with her case. She says, “That was the beginning. From then on, Barney and I, every Friday night, we’re out at the officer’s club.” She laughs, and Siegel pauses for an uncomfortable moment, unsure how to react to this statement—Hill’s fond reminiscing about being invited to the officer’s club doesn’t square with Siegel’s understanding of the abductee as “anesthetized patient” (Brown 5). Her humor gives away a part of her “made-up” identity that seeks not legitimacy, but community and recognition."
