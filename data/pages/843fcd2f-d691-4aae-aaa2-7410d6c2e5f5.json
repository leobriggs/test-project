{"content":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"The 1961 abduction of Barney and Betty Hill is arguably the most famous close encounter in American history; since the story of their abduction went public, it has been the subject of several books, documentaries, scholarly analyses, and fictionalized works. The events of the Hill case have become emblematic of the archetypal alien abduction scenario: while driving from Montreal, Canada, to their hometown of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the Hills noticed a strange aircraft emitting multicolored lights that approached them on the highway. They were captured by a group of small grey alien beings and subjected to strange medical examinations, after which the couple was returned to their car in a state of confusion and altered consciousness. Barney and Betty subsequently underwent hypnosis with Dr. Benjamin Simon in order to recall the events of that evening. Their account was leaked to the press and published on the front page of The Boston Traveller four years after the abduction event. Barney Hill died of a stroke in 1969; Betty became a UFO enthusiast and pseudo-celebrity before she died in 2004."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"In 2002, Betty Hill was the guest on the inaugural episode of The UFO Connection, a public-access television show in Sacramento, California. The UFO Connection was hosted by fellow UFO enthusiast Cynthia Siegel, who is an active member in local UFO organizations. The episode is an interview between Siegel and Hill, who calls in from her home in New Hampshire and does not appear on camera or in the studio. Siegel sits alone in the studio, speaking with Betty for about an hour, until they run out of time and the interview is cut short by the rolling credits. The interview begins with a discussion of the press attention the Hills received in 1965, but it largely focuses on the events of Hill’s abduction and the immediate aftermath of the event. There is a discussion of the U.S. military’s interest in the Hills’ case, and subsequent UFO sightings in the New Hampshire area."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Why listen closely to the ramblings of an alleged alien abductee and an amateur public-access television host? Why treat spectacularized conspiracies as a viable subject of study at all? Listening closely to the sound of truth rubbing against make-believe illuminates new ways of theorizing from the perspective of the boundary between reality and fantasy (and the kinds of people who linger on this boundary). Alien abductees are prime examples of what philosopher Ian Hacking calls a “made-up person,” which he uses to define how “people classified in a certain way tend to conform to or grow into the ways they are described; but they also evolve” (30). The classification of abductee, argues science fiction scholar Roger Luckhurst, turns the abductee into “a switching center that bears the marks of shifting configurations of interior subjectivity and exterior embodiment” (32). In other words, while abductees tend to “conform or grow into the ways they are described” by narrativizing their experiences in strikingly similar ways, these stories also evolve over time as the abductee rehearses their story over and over for different audiences. This narrative adaptability mirrors the fluidity of the abductee’s identity itself and the shifting meanings assigned to the abductee."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Bridget Brown uses a historical and sociocultural lens to ground the alien abductee in the context of larger social and technological forces.

Listening to the abductee, then, becomes a method to understand “how people left out of certain narratives of progress create their own stories and fashion truths that square with their own experience of the world” (Brown 7). These stories, while they stem from a place of disempowerment and marginalization, give the abductee a bound sense of authorial authority."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"In what follows, I listen closely to Betty Hill for clues about how this process of creating stories and fashioning truths intersects with her status as a “made-up person.” I argue that Betty Hill both reifies and subverts the cultural identity of the abductee through a well-rehearsed storytelling practice that navigates discourses of evidence while maintaining agency over her lived experience. Furthermore, the strategies she uses in the interview are emblematic of a collective process of rehearsed storytelling that abductees engage in order to make sense of experiences that have cast them to the fringes of societal legitimacy. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Rehearsed storytelling is the process by which abductees’ classifications, legitimacy, and social currency become deeply tied to the story of their abduction—it is part of the process of “making up” the abductee. In this audiovisual artifact, Betty Hill recounts the night of her abduction over forty years after the event occurred. Over time, the way that she tells the story evolves to respond to the audience she addresses. The creation of narrative is guided at times by Hill and also by Siegel, who has her own preconceptions and motivations, and her audience in mind. Throughout the interview, Siegel steps into the role of director in Hill’s rehearsal, leaving Betty to fulfill the role of performer. Because of this role reversal and Hill’s physical absence from the space, the conversational flow becomes dissonant often. Siegel is in a tricky position as the interviewer, since she cannot rely on visual cues from Betty about breaks in the conversation. At the same time, she is hypervisible to the audience, being the only on-camera presence. This results in an unsettling combination of interruptions, crosstalk, and oversized physical reactions on the part of Siegel. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"By listening for these dissonances, I find the places where the rehearsed storytelling process reveals itself as a dynamic and dialectic process. The dominant cultural understanding of the abductee has a preoccupation with physical evidence of the abduction and the emotional/sexual violation of the medical examination; Hill navigates the contours of this dominant narrative, at times employing humor and the alternative temporality of the abduction event as creative strategies to resist her own categorization. Next, I will discuss how discourses of evidence and themes of emotional and sexual violation shape the rehearsed storytelling that Hill engages in, and how this reflects larger processes of narrative that “make up” the collective identity of the abductee. Then, I will discuss how Hill employs humor and non-normative temporality to subvert and expand this identity-making process."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"As Siegel prepares the audience to hear Hill recount the night of her abduction, she says, “I know you're very seasoned at telling this story. As I said, it truly is—first of all, it's one of the most impeccable cases, there's a remarkable amount of physical evidence and nobody has been able to dispute it.” Immediately, Siegel situates the source of Betty Hill’s authority directly within the supposed legitimacy of her story. At various points, her line of inquiry points to Barney’s broken binocular straps, his scuffed shoes, and Betty’s torn dress, lauding them all as indisputable evidence of the legitimacy of Betty’s claim. “Okay, so his shoes were scuffed. What else? What about your watches? Wasn’t there—” Siegel probes, before Betty cuts her off. “And both of our watches had stopped functioning,” Betty replies. Siegel’s preoccupation with evidence underlines how legitimacy and proof become dominant forces that shape the arc of the abduction narrative. She prompts Betty to foreground the tangible, material ephemera of her experience over the affective, embodied, or immaterial elements of the encounter. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Siegel’s insistence on Hill detailing the physical evidence of her abduction reveals a collective impulse to legitimize these spectacular narratives, the telling of which immediately delegitimizes the storyteller. Bridget Brown notes that most scholarship on alien abduction attempts to situate it “at the intersection of psychology and religion, or myth,” suggesting either an explanation of disorder or simply belief (7). Brown argues that these intersections foreclose study of the material reality of the abductee’s life by pathologizing and delegitimizing them. Siegel unwillingly participates in this practice by constantly prompting Hill to recount the supposed proof. However, “nonmaterial ideas, beliefs, and presences may illicit in us very real reactions, emotions, and behaviors,” suggesting that “the pain of alien abduction is indeed real because it has real effects” (Brown 9). What else would we hear if we listened to alien abductees with an attunement to their reality, without the goal of legitimizing them?

Siegel’s insistence on what she perceives to be an appropriate reaction meets Hill’s refusal to engage with fear until the story itself calls for it. The process of rehearsed storytelling happens in this space, where the dominant affect of the alien abductee is reified by Siegel and disrupted by Betty’s responses. “No fear, no nothing,” she reassures. This is the first example of several questions to the effect of, “Weren’t you afraid?” The conversation reflects the dialectic process of narrativizing the emotions felt by the abductee in a way that aligns with the worldview of the abductee as a victim, as the kind of person that something happens to."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Later, physical and psychic pain emerge as topics of interest for Siegel in Hill’s discussion of the medical examination. The examination is the pinnacle of spectacular and sexualized bodily violation and trauma for the alien abductee, and it is such a hallmark component that it’s practically synonymous with abduction itself. Bridget Brown charts the shift in alien abduction narratives from “the sort of large-scale military conflict posited in The War of the Worlds–type science fictions” to “profoundly intimate, a physical, sexual, and psychological invasion of self” (5). Similarly, literary scholar Patricia Barbeito theorizes that “the aliens’ technological disruption of the natural female body becomes the prevalent way of signaling the traumatic disruption of hegemonic narratives of identity and history” (202). Listening to Betty during this point in the narrative, she sounds hurried; she isn’t trying to dwell on the climactic moment of the examination, when her alien captors perform a “pregnancy test” by inserting a long needle into her navel. “Okay, but let’s spend a minute on that, though,” Siegel replies, redirecting the conversation towards her understanding of the details audiences are dying to know about Hill’s experience."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"While Siegel and Hill’s conversation reifies the typical narrative of abduction with a focus on legitimization and victimization, Hill also expresses how “participating in the cultural practice of being an alien abductee” allows her to become an agent “in the social drama of alien abduction” (Brown 18). To observe this, I listen for her sense of humor, which becomes another component of her rehearsed storytelling practice. One of the most salient examples happens when Hill is discussing the U.S. military’s involvement with her case. She says, “That was the beginning. From then on, Barney and I, every Friday night, we’re out at the officer’s club.” She laughs, and Siegel pauses for an uncomfortable moment, unsure how to react to this statement—Hill’s fond reminiscing about being invited to the officer’s club doesn’t square with Siegel’s understanding of the abductee as “anesthetized patient” (Brown 5). Her humor gives away a part of her “made-up” identity that seeks not legitimacy, but community and recognition."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"In another telling exchange that demonstrates Hill’s use of humor and shifting temporality as a creative strategy to retain agency over her narrative, Siegel asks about Betty being separated from her husband prior to the medical examination."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Siegel: Was that more alarming to you to be separated from Barney at that stage?"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Hill: Nope."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Siegel: No?"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Hill: Nope.

She cannot be that alarmed to be separated from Barney because the entire experience is, in her words, “a new situation.” Her long pause as she struggles to find words seems to remind Siegel of Hill’s identity beyond that of a storyteller; she apologizes to Hill before redirecting the conversation back towards the question, “Were you afraid?” Of course, this doesn’t represent a totalizing shift in the process or end result of “making up” the abductee, but it does make a little more room inside that categorization for humanity, for curiosity, for awe, for humor, and for relationality that return narrative and authorial control to Betty in subtle, temporary ways."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"In this interview, Betty Hill both reifies and subverts the cultural identity of the abductee using creative strategies of rehearsed storytelling, including humor and shifting temporality.
